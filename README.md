The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the genre of a movie based solely on its plot summary or other textual information. With the exponential growth of digital media platforms and streaming services, categorizing movies into genres automatically can greatly enhance user experience, recommendation systems, and content organization.

Approach:

Data Collection

Preprocessing

Feature Extraction:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency),
Word Embeddings

Model Selection:
Naive Bayes,
Logistic Regression,
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Model Training and Evaluation 

Model Deployment

Continuous Improvement

By accurately predicting movie genres based on textual information, this project aims to enhance the efficiency of content categorization and recommendation systems in the entertainment industry. Additionally, the techniques and methodologies employed can be extended to other text classification tasks beyond movie genres.
