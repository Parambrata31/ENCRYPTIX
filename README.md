Spam SMS detection is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. The goal is to develop an AI model capable of accurately distinguishing between spam (unsolicited, often commercial) and legitimate SMS messages. This task is essential for enhancing user experience, security, and privacy in mobile communication.

Approach:

Text Preprocessing

Feature Extraction:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), Word Embeddings

Model Selection and Training:
Naive Bayes,
Logistic Regression.
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Model Evaluation

Hyperparameter Tuning

Cross-Validation

Deployment and Monitoring

By building an effective AI model for spam SMS detection, it becomes possible to protect users from unwanted messages, improve mobile communication security, and enhance overall user experience
