Customer churn prediction is a vital task for businesses, especially subscription-based services, as it helps in understanding and anticipating customer behavior. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (i.e., discontinue their subscription or leave the service) based on historical data. By identifying potential churners early, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and minimize revenue loss.

Approach:

Data Collection:
Demographic details (age, gender, location),
Usage behavior (frequency of service/product usage, duration of subscription),
Customer interactions (complaints, inquiries, feedback),
Transaction history (purchase frequency, payment method),
Engagement metrics (click-through rates, app usage, website visits)

Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values,
Encoding categorical variables,
Feature scaling,
Feature engineering

Feature Selection

Model Training:
Logistic Regression,
Random Forests,
Gradient Boosting

Model Evaluation:
Accuracy,
Precision,
Recall,
F1-score

Hyperparameter Tuning

Validation and Testing

Deployment and Monitoring

By developing an effective churn prediction model, businesses can proactively identify customers at risk of churn, tailor retention strategies, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and retention rates.
